# Filthy, Awful Swarm of Heroes
#### SCHOOL PROJECT - COMP 1501 
  The specifications of this assignment required us to use Python and Utilize the Pygame library. This was a first year project and the 
structure/design of my code is reflective of such. I spent around 3-5 days on this assignment.
  
In Retrospect I would improve on the project in the following ways,
1. Would create a 'character' superclass which all entities would inherit from
1. Would implement 'observer' design pattern to keep track of game state in level
   1. keep track of existing player character(s)
   1.
1. Would implement sound effects/soundtrack
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
